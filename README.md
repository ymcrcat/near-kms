# NEAR KMS

The NEAR KMS (Key Management System) is a secure smart contract system for managing cryptographic keys using Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technologies on the NEAR Protocol. This project provides secure key derivation, attestation verification, and access control mechanisms for TEE-based applications.

The system enables secure key management for CVMs running in TEE environments in a decentralized approach, ensuring that only verified and approved TEE instances can access and derive cryptographic keys through integration with the NEAR MPC (Multi-Party Computation) network.

## Overview

The system consists of two main smart contracts:

1. **KMS Contract** (`near-dstack-kms`)
   - Manages KMS root key derivation from the NEAR MPC network
   - Verifies TEE attestation (quote, collateral, TCB info)
   - Manages allowed compose hashes, OS image hashes, and device IDs
   - Controls access to key derivation operations
   - Supports app registration and management

2. **App Contract** (`near-dstack-app`)
   - Validates app boot information and attestation
   - Manages allowed compose hashes and device IDs per app
   - Provides app-level access control and validation
   - Integrates with KMS contract for key management

## Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo (latest stable version)
- [`cargo-near`](https://github.com/near/cargo-near) - NEAR smart contract development toolkit
- NEAR CLI - For interacting with NEAR blockchain
- A NEAR account with sufficient NEAR tokens for contract deployment

## Setup and Deployment

### 1. Build the Contracts

Install [`cargo-near`](https://github.com/near/cargo-near) if you haven't already:

```bash
cargo install cargo-near --locked
```

Build all contracts:

```bash
make all
```

This will:
- Run linting (format and clippy)
- Build the KMS contract
- Build the App contract
- Copy WASM files to `contracts/*/res/` directories

To build individual contracts:

```bash
# Build KMS contract only
make kms-contract

# Build App contract only
make app-contract

# Build mock MPC contract (for testing)
make mock-mpc-contract
```

### 2. Test the Contracts

Run all tests:

```bash
make test
```

This will:
- Build all contracts (KMS, App, and mock MPC)
- Run integration tests with the `test` feature enabled

The test suite includes:
- KMS contract initialization and configuration
- Compose hash management (add/remove)
- OS image hash management
- Aggregated MR management
- Device ID management
- Gateway app ID configuration
- Root key request functionality
- App contract registration via factory method
- App contract initialization and management
- Device ID management for apps
- Access control verification

## Usage Examples

### Request KMS Root Key

Request a KMS root key from the MPC network:

```bash
cd scripts/testnet  # or scripts/mainnet
./request-root-key.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
near call <kms-contract-id> request_kms_root_key \
  --args '{
    "quote_hex": "<quote-hex-string>",
    "collateral": "<collateral-json-string>",
    "tcb_info": "<tcb-info-json-string>",
    "worker_public_key": {"Bls12381G1PublicKey": "<public-key>"}
  }' \
  --depositYocto 1 \
  --gas 300000000000000 \
  --accountId <caller-account-id>
```

### Add Compose Hash to KMS

```bash
near call <kms-contract-id> add_kms_compose_hash \
  --args '{"compose_hash": "<compose-hash>"}' \
  --accountId <owner-account-id>
```

### Add Compose Hash to App

```bash
near call <app-contract-id> add_compose_hash \
  --args '{"compose_hash": "<compose-hash>"}' \
  --accountId <owner-account-id>
```

### Register App Contract

Register and deploy an app contract via the KMS factory method:

```bash
near call <kms-contract-id> register_app \
  --args '{
    "app_id": "<app-id>",
    "owner_id": "<owner-account-id>",
    "disable_upgrades": false,
    "allow_any_device": false,
    "initial_device_id": null,
    "initial_compose_hash": null
  }' \
  --deposit <deposit-amount> \
  --accountId <owner-account-id>
```

This will create a subaccount `<app-id>.<kms-contract-id>`, deploy the app contract, initialize it, and register it with the KMS.

### Add OS Image Hash to KMS

```bash
near call <kms-contract-id> add_os_image_hash \
  --args '{"os_image_hash": "<os-image-hash>"}' \
  --accountId <owner-account-id>
```

### Add KMS Aggregated MR

```bash
near call <kms-contract-id> add_kms_aggregated_mr \
  --args '{"mr_aggregated": "<mr-aggregated>"}' \
  --accountId <owner-account-id>
```

### Add KMS Device ID

```bash
near call <kms-contract-id> add_kms_device \
  --args '{"device_id": "<device-id>"}' \
  --accountId <owner-account-id>
```

## Security Considerations

- **TEE Attestation**: All key derivation requests require valid TEE attestation (quote, collateral, TCB info)
- **Compose Hash Verification**: Only approved compose hashes can be used for key operations
- **OS Image Verification**: Only approved OS image hashes are allowed
- **Aggregated MR Verification**: Only approved aggregated measurement registers (MRs) are allowed for KMS
- **Device ID Validation**: Optional device ID allowlist provides additional security layer for both KMS and App contracts
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control ensures only authorized accounts can perform administrative operations
- **Pausable Operations**: Critical operations can be paused for security incidents
- **Upgrade Control**: Contract upgrades are controlled and can be permanently disabled
- **Factory Pattern**: App contracts are deployed via KMS factory method, ensuring proper registration and initialization

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test file
cargo test --test test_kms_contract
cargo test --test test_app_contract

# Run with output
cargo test --features test -- --nocapture
```

### Building WASM Files with Docker

The `cargo-near` toolchain requires a C compiler with wasm32 target support (e.g., for the `ring` crate). On macOS this may not work out of the box. A `Dockerfile` is provided to build the WASM files in a containerized environment:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t near-kms-builder .

# Build all contract WASMs inside the container
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/workspace near-kms-builder bash -c \
  "cd contracts/kms && cargo near build reproducible-wasm && \
   cd ../app && cargo near build reproducible-wasm && \
   cd ../mock-mpc && cargo near build reproducible-wasm"
```

The compiled WASM files will be available in the `contracts/*/res/` directories and can then be used for running tests locally.

### Linting

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt --all

# Run clippy
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings

# Or use make
make lint
```

## Architecture

### Key Derivation Flow

1. TEE instance generates attestation quote, collateral, and TCB info
2. TEE instance calls `request_kms_root_key` with:
   - `quote_hex`: Hex-encoded quote bytes
   - `collateral`: JSON string containing collateral data
   - `tcb_info`: JSON string containing TCB info
   - `worker_public_key`: BLS12-381 public key for key derivation
3. KMS contract verifies attestation (quote, collateral, TCB info)
4. KMS contract checks compose hash is in allowlist
5. KMS contract requests key derivation from NEAR MPC network using CKD (Child Key Derivation)
6. MPC network derives key using BLS12-381 cryptography with derivation path `"kms-root-key"`
7. Key derivation result is returned via callback to `set_kms_info`
8. KMS info (k256_pubkey, ca_pubkey, quote, eventlog) is stored in contract state

### App Validation Flow

1. App provides boot information (`AppBootInfo`) including:
   - `app_id`: The app contract account ID
   - `compose_hash`: Docker compose hash
   - `instance_id`: Instance account ID
   - `device_id`: Device identifier
   - `mr_aggregated`: Aggregated measurement register
   - `mr_system`: System measurement register
   - `os_image_hash`: OS image hash
   - `tcb_status`: TCB status (e.g., "UpToDate")
   - `advisory_ids`: Security advisory IDs
2. App contract validates compose hash is in allowlist
3. App contract validates device ID (if `allow_any_device` is `false`)
4. If all validations pass, app is allowed to boot (returns `(true, "")`)
5. If validation fails, returns `(false, "error message")`
